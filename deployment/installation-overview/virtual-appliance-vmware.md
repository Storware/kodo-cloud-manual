# Virtual Appliance \(VMware\)

A virtual appliance \(VA\) is a virtual machine image file consisting of a pre-configured operating system environment and a single application. KODO for Cloud VA is the CentOS-based virtual machine with KODO for Cloud server, already installed and ready to configure.

The virtual machine has the following configuration:

* 4 vCPUs
* 16 GB RAM
* 1 TB backup storage space \(logically it is 3 TB of storage space with the VDO option\)

## Accessing virtual machine <a id="accessing-virtual-machine"></a>

A preconfigured virtual machine appliance in the OVA format is ready to deploy in the VMware virtual environment in version 6.5 or above. You can download KODO for Cloud VA from the following link:

â€‹[ftp://ftp.storware.eu/](ftp://kodo4cloud@ftp.storware.eu/)

Use the following credentials to access the ftp server:  
**Login:** kodo4cloud   
**Password:** sEkQsrdsr98Q

If you successfully downloaded the OVA file, please deploy it in your virtual environment. The network card IP address is assigned automatically by DHCP protocol.

## Logging into the virtual appliance

Once the virtual machine is deployed in the VMware environment, use the credentials listed below to log into the virtual machine:

> **Login:** kodo  
> **Password:** Zt3edWny

{% hint style="warning" %}
### NOTE: FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE CHANGE THE PASSWORD AFTER THE FIRST LOGIN TO THE SYSTEM.
{% endhint %}

Use `passwd` command to change the password for **kodo** user

```text
$ passwd
```

Type the old password and the new password two times:

```text
Changing password for kodo.
Old Password:
New Password:
Retype New Password:
```

## Setting up the network configuration

The next step is to configure the network connection. To do this you will need to edit the network configuration file. The default configuration will assign an IP address from the DHCP server.

Use `sudo` command to run a shell with root privileges:

```text
$ sudo -s
```

When asking for a password use the one for **`kodo`** user.

Edit network configuration file:

```text
# nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192
```

To set up a static IP address change the BOOTPROTO parameter:

```text
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
```

to

```text
BOOTPROTO=static
```

Next, add to the file the following options:

* IPADDR=YOUR\_IP\_ADDRESS
* NETMASK=YOUR\_NETMASK
* GATEWAY=YOUR\_GATEWAY

and set them according to your local network: 

**IPADDR** - IP address of KODO Server  
**NETMASK** - netmask value of your network  
**GATEWAY** - gateway value of your network

Here you have a sample configuration file:

```text
TYPE=Ethernet
PROXY_METHOD=none
BROWSER_ONLY=no
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
NETMASK=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
GATEWAY=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
DEFROUTE=yes
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE=stable-privacy
NAME=ens192
DEVICE=ens192
ONBOOT=yes
```

Save the file by pressing the `CTRL+o` and then `Enter` key.

After the file is saved you can exit the editor by pressing `CTRL+x` key combination.

The final step is to restart the network configuration.  Use the following command:

```text
# systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
```

Now you should be able to log into the web console using the URL: `https://KODO_SERVER_HOST:8181`, where `KODO_SERVER_HOST`is the hostname or IP address of your Kodo for Cloud server. 

```text
https://KODO_SERVER_HOST_IP:8181
```
