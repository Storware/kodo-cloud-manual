# Filesystem

Log into the Kodoadmin dashboard as `kodadmin` and go to the Storage menu.

Click the **Add Storage** button to configure a destination location for backup. You can define storage out of two available storage types: FILE SYSTEM or AZURE BLOB.

If you select the **FILE SYSTEM** as the storage type, you have to assign a name to and enter a valid storage path \(it can be a path of a regular filesystem or a VDO device\).
