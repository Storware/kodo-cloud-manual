# Launching the cloud agent

After KODO for Cloud server is deployed, the cloud agent is in an inactive state by default. You have to go to the **Agents** menu and launch the cloud agent manually. In the **Agents** window should be a warning with the following message: "**The following agents are not available: agent\_name**". The default name for the KODO cloud agent is **voyager**.

To launch the agent, go to the **Options** menu and click the **Play** button.

Now the activity status in the **Active** column should be changed from **No** to **Yes**. 

Go to the [Storage configuration chapter](https://storware.gitbook.io/kodo-for-cloud-office365/kodo-for-cloud-documentation/deployment/initial-configuration/storage-configuration) to learn about storage configuration.
