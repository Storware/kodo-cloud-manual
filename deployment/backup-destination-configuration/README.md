# Backup destinations

Before you start the KODO for Cloud installation process you have to configure a data storage device. KODO for Cloud server can store data on the following devices:

* block devices \(local hard drives or iSCSI\)
* NFS/SMB share configured on a NAS device: e.g. NetApp or DELL EMC DataDomain.
* Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
* Virtual Data Optimizer \(VDO\)

If you are going to use a local disk or VDO option to store your data, you have to configure a block device on a server in both cases.

Go to the[ Filesystems](filesystem/) chapter to learn what filesystems the administrator is able to configure on KODO for Cloud server.
