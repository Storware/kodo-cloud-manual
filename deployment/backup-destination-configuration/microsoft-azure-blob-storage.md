# Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

KODO for Cloud server supports integration with MS Azure Blob Storage. An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS protocols. If you are not familiar with the Azure Blob storage, please read the documentation available at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/).

To configure the Azure Blob Storage as a backup destination for KODO for Cloud server you need the following information:

* Storage account name  
* One of the account keys

The information will be required later on when  KODO for Cloud server is installed add will be ready for BLOB storage configuration \(see the [Define a storage type for a backup destination](../first-steps-after-deployment/storage-configuration-path/define-storage-type.md) chapter\).

Go to the [Cloud Agent-additional instance \(optional\)](../cloud-agent.md) chapter to learn how to configure the cloud agent instance.
