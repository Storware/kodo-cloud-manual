# Filesystems

This section presents the key steps necessary to configure the filesystem as your backup destination. You can use a [Disk filesystem](regular-filesystem.md) \(including remote NFS or SMB shares\) or attach a block device and configure [Virtual Data Optimizer \(VDO\)](virtual-data-optimizer-vdo.md).

Go to the[ Disk filesystem](regular-filesystem.md) chapter to learn how to configure disk systems.
