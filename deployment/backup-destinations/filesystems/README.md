This section presents the key steps necessary to configure the filesystem as your backup destination. You can use a regular disk filesystem \(e.g. xfs, ext4  or NFS/SMB shares\) or attach a block device and configure Virtual Data Optimizer \(VDO\).  

Go to the [Disk filesystem ]()chapter to learn how to configure disk filesystems.
