# Storage configuration path

After KODO for Cloud server was successfully installed, you can proceed with storage configuration to define a backup storage destination.

In the first step it's required to configure the following system assets:

* Storage \(**FILE SYSTEM** or **AZURE BLOB**\)
* Agent Config 

and in the next steps do the following actions:

* Assign defined agent config to the agent
* Assign agent config\(s\) to defined KODO organization

Go to the [Define a storage type for a backup destination](define-storage-type.md) chapter to learn about how to define storage type for backup.
