Scheduled backup is excecuted continuously at a fixed time, based on the schedule.   

After creation, the defined job is ready to start and it is in the **Scheduled** state. When the time set in the job comes, the server will generate a task for each selected user or site. The tasks will wait in a queue to be processed by the cloud agent instance.
