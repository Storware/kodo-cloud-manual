# Backup

There are only two backup levels in Kodo for Cloud server.  

## Full

Full backup is done automatically by default when user\(s\) from defined job are protected for the first time. The administrator can force full on-demand backup any time it's needed.  

### Incremental backup

Incremental backup is a default backup type. Only one initial full backup is done, every next backup in chain is the incremental one.
