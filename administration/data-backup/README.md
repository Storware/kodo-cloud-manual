# Backup

## Full

A full backup is done automatically by default when a user\(s\) from a defined job is protected for the first time. You can also force a full on-demand backup. 

### Incremental backup

Incremental backup is a default backup type. Only one initial full backup is done, every another backup in the chain is incremental.
