# Backup types

KODO for Cloud server can perform backups and restore operations in a very effective way. It allows to shorten the backup window and save the storage space required for data because it utilizes only two backup levels.  

## Full

A full backup is done automatically by default when user\(s\) or site\(s\) in a defined job are protected for the first time. Only one initial full backup is done.  The administrator can force the full on-demand backup any time it's needed.  

### Incremental backup

Incremental backup is the default backup type on KODO for Cloud server. Only one initial full backup is done, every subsequent backup is the incremental one.
