# Backup

There are two levels of backup in Kodo for Cloud

## Full

Full backup is done automatically by default when user\(s\) from defined job are protected for the first time. You can also force full on-demand backup . 

### Incremental backup

Incremental backup is a default backup type. Only one initial full backup is done, every another backup in chain is incremental.
