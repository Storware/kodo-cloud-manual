# Backup

KODO for Cloud server can perform backups and restore operations in very effective way. It allows to shorten the backup window and save a storage space required for data, because it uses only two backup levels.  

## Full

Full backup is done automatically by default when user\(s\) from defined job are protected for the first time. The administrator can force full on-demand backup any time it's needed.  

### Incremental backup

Incremental backup is a default backup type. Only one initial full backup is done, every next backup in chain is the incremental one.
