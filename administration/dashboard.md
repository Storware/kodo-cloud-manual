After successful installation of **KODO for Cloud**, administrator can log into application using popular web browser \(e.g. Google Chrome, MozillaFirefox or MS IE Edge\). To do to this, use IP address of the server where "**KODO for Cloud**" server was installed. 

`https://KODO_server_IP_address`
