# Stage

A stage is a dedicated area on the file system that is used as a temporary location for data downloaded from Microsoft 365 until the whole process is completed. Next, the data is moved to the target destination. Here you can edit the following settings:

* Staging path (default path is /kodo\_data/staging)
* Staging storage free space warning threshold (size in MB or GB)

Go to the [Logs](https://storware.gitbook.io/kodo-for-cloud-office365/administration/kodoadmin-user-guide/settings/logs) section to learn how to configure logs settings.
