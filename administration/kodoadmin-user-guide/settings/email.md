# Email

You have to configure the email settings to allow the server to send notifications to the defined system administrators. Fill up the forms with the following settings:

* **E-mail address** - enter an email address of the sender
* **Login** - usually it's the same as the email address of the sender
* **Server address -** SMTP server IP name or address \(for Microsoft 365 service the server name is smtp.office365.com\), but you can use any other SMTP server.
* **Port** - usually it's port 25 or 587.
* **use SSL** - select it if you want to use SSL protocol.
* **Password -** the password for the user provided in the "**Login**" form.
