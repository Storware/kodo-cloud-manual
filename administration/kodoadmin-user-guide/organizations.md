# Organizations

There is only one default organization \(My Organization\), created during KODO for Cloud server installation. The default organization has assigned all licenses to, so if you would like to add another organization, you have to decrease the number of assigned users to the organization.

You can disable, edit, or delete the default organization by selecting one of the options from the **Options** menu.
