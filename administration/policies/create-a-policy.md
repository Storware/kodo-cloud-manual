## Retention time

KODO for Cloud gives you the flexibility to configure backup retention. Backup retention settings apply only to items \(like files or messages\) that have been deleted from the source.

If you configure retention for 7 days you will have 7 days to restore item\(s\) deleted by the user. All data that exist at the source will never be deleted.

### Versions to keep

You can specify the number of backup versions to keep.

{% hint style="info" %}
Minimum value for **Versions to keep** is 1. The default value is 5.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Versioning is used e.g. for OneDrive files \(if the file is changed in time\), but also e-mail messages can have many version \(mail draft changed in time\)
{% endhint %}
