Data policy allows you to configure the following settings:

* Set a default policy
* Backup retention \(day\(s\), month\(s\), year\(s\)\)
* Number of protected item\(s\) or file\(s\) versions 
* Protected Microsoft 365 services \(SLA\):
  * Exchange Online Mailbox
  * Exchange Online Calendars
  * Exchange Online Contacts
  * OneDrive for Business

{% hint style="info" %}
Versioning is used e.g. for OneDrive files \(if the file is changed in time\), but also e-mail messages can have many version \(mail draft changed in time\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of versions that the server keeps is also affected by the time retention setting. Versions expire when the number of days that they are inactive exceeds the value that is specified for retaining, even when the number of versions is not exceeded.
{% endhint %}
