# Backup types

## Incremental

Incremental backup is a default backup type. Only one initial full backup is done, every other backup in chain is incremental.

## Full

Full backup is done automatically when user is protected for the first time. You can also force full backup manually.

### Forcing full backup from manual backup

When [performing manual backup](performing-manual-backup.md) select Advance options and select for which features you would like to perform full backup.
