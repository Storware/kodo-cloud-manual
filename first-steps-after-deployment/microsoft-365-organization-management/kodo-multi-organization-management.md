# KODO Multi-Organization Management

On KODO for Cloud server, the administrator can define more than one Microsoft 365 organization to protect. In a purchased license the following limitations are included:

* **MAX\_ORGANIZATIONS** - the maximum number of organizations to define.
* **MAX\_TENANTS\_PER\_ORG** - the maximum number of tenants to define per organization
* **MAX\_USERS**- the maximum number of protected users.

 More information about licensing can be found in the [Licensing ](../../overview/licensing.md)chapter.

You can add a Microsoft 365 organization manually or using the Setup assistant. To add the organization go to the Settings menu and click **Add Organization**. Now you can choose one of the options: **Manually** or **Setup Assistant**.
