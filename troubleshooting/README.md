#### Getting access to the CloudAgent logs

CloudAgent logs contain information about backup and restore operation for Office365.

1. Log in to the system where CloudAgent is installed
2. Go to /opt/storware/kodo-agent/logs path

If necessary you can download logs using SCP client of your choice \(e.g. WinSCP\)
