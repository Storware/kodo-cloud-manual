# Licensing

KODO for Cloud server is licensed per number of protected user accounts in the Microsoft 365 service. You can buy a perpetual license \(e.g. 1 Year Subscription and Support\) or choose the monthly subscription.

The license price does not depend on the number of organizations or tenants you want to configure in KODO for Cloud server.

The shared mailboxes are not utilizing the KODO license.

There is an option to buy additional years of support and subscription by contacting our sales team at: [globalsales@storware.eu](mailto:globalsales@storware.eu).
