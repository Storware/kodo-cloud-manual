# Backup Storage

Before you start the installation process you have to configure a data storage device. The KODO for Cloud server can store data on the following devices:

* block devices \(hard drives, SSD drives\)
* NFS share \(configured on a NAS device \(e.g. NetApp or DELLEMC  DataDomain\)\)

## Backup Storage overview

If you are going to use a local disk or VDO option to store your data, you have to configure a block device on server in both cases.
