# Multi-tenancy architecture

KODO for Cloud server was designed in a multi-tenancy architecture, which means that you can define multiple instances of organizations on. Within each organization \(tenant\) you can define more than one Microsoft 365 organization.  

The number of organizations is limited only by your license \(maximum number of users\).
