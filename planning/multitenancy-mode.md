# Multi-tenancy

You can configure several organizations on the KODO for Cloud server. The number of organizations is limited only by your license \(maximum number of users\).  

Go to the section [Microsoft 365 Organization Management](../deployment/common-tasks/microsoft-365-organization-management/) to get to know how to add your organization to the KODO for Cloud server.
