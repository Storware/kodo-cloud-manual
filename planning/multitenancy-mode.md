# Multi-tenancy

KODO for Cloud server was designed to support multi-tenancy features, which means that you can protect more than one Microsoft 365 organization. 

You can configure several organizations on the server. The number of organizations is limited only by your license \(maximum number of users\).  

Go to [KODO Multi-Organization Management](../first-steps-after-deployment/microsoft-365-organization-management/kodo-multi-organization-management.md) section to get to know how to add your organization to KODO for Cloud server.
