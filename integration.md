# Integration

In this section, we're going to highlight key aspects necessary to integrate 3rd party solutions with KODO for Cloud. We assume a typical scenario, where you want to invoke KODO for Cloud operations on behalf of a user of a self-service portal. We assume that end-user uses the above-mentioned portal for a subset of administrative actions, and we want to give user ability to perform basic backup related operations.
